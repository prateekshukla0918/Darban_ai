## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React.js (Functional components & Hooks)
- JavaScript
- Plain CSS (no external UI libraries)

## 😄 Emoji Categories

Players choose from 6 unique emoji sets before the match:

- **Animals:** 🐕 🐈 🦊 🐼 ...
- **Food:** 🍕 🍔 🧁 🍫 ...
- **Sports:** ⚽ 🏀 🏐 🏸 ...
- **Travel:** ✈️ 🚗 🛵 🚀 ...
- **Nature:** 🌸 🌳 🍁 🍄 ...
- **Faces:** 😀 😂 😎 🤩 ...

Each category offers 14 expressive emojis for personalized gameplay.

## 👻 Vanishing Rule (Core Twist)

Each player is limited to **3 emojis** on the board:
- When a 4th move is made, the **oldest emoji automatically vanishes**.
- This is managed with a **queue-based system** that tracks moves per player and pops the earliest one when the limit is exceeded.

This keeps the board dynamic and forces players to rethink classic strategies.

## 🔊 Sound Effects

All key actions include sounds (e.g., click, place, win, error), making the experience more immersive and fun.
